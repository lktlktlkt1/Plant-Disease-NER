a O

all O

the O

was O
found O
to O
proceed O
asynchronously O
in O
the O

, O
mainly O
because O
of O
an O
unequal O

. O

the O
transition O
from O
the O

we O
further O
examined O
the O

in O

. O

gene O
loss O
in O
the O

group O
was O
complete O
, O
owing O
to O
infertility B-Disease
of O
the O
male O

and O
the O
fact O
that O

out O

only O
one O

this O

the O
only O

no O

it O
