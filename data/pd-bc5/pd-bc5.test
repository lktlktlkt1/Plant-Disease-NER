conclusion O

we O
found O

independently O

not O

the O

six O
epidemiologic O

that O

as O
a O
result O
of O
these O

, O
phenacetin O
has O
now O
been O
withdrawn O

however O
, O
three O

, O
one O
each O
in O
north O

, O
northern O

, O
and O
west O

, O
showed O
that O
habitual O
use O
of O
acetaminophen O
is O
also O
associated O
with O
chronic B-Disease
renal I-Disease

and O
esrd B-Disease
, O
with O
a O
relative O
risk O
in O
the O
range O

2 O

. O

these O
studies O
suggest O
that O
both O
phenacetin O
and O
acetaminophen O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
burden O
of O
esrd B-Disease
, O
with O
the O
risk O
of O
the O
latter O
being O
somewhat O
less O
than O
that O
of O
the O
former O
. O

this O
apparent O
difference O
in O
risk O
may O
not O
be O
due O
to O
differences O
in O
nephrotoxic B-Disease
potential O
of O
the O
drugs O
themselves O
. O

a O
lower O
relative O
risk O
would O
be O
expected O
for O
acetaminophen O
if O
the O
risk O
of O
both O
drugs O
in O

analgesics O
was O
higher O
than O
the O
risk O

either O

thus O
, O
acetaminophen O
has O
been O
used O
both O
as O
a O

agent O
and O
in O
combination O
with O
other O
analgesics O
, O
whereas O
phenacetin O
was O
available O
only O
in O
combinations O
. O

the O
possibility O
that O
habitual O
use O

alone O
increases O
the O
risk O
